# Do Not Commit Changes to Git

**IMPORTANT**: Do not automatically commit changes to git. Always ask the user before making any git commits.

## Rules:
- Never run `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push` commands without explicit user permission
- When suggesting git operations, always ask the user first
- If you need to stage files, ask the user if they want to commit the changes
- Let the user control their own git workflow and commit messages

## Exceptions:
- Only run git commands if the user explicitly asks you to do so
- You may suggest git commands but must wait for user confirmation before executing them
